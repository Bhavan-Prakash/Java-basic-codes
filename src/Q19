Scenario:

You’re designing a Smart Home System that controls different types of devices.

Requirements:

Create an interface Connectable with methods:

connectToWiFi(String networkName)

disconnect()

Create an abstract class SmartDevice with:

Fields: deviceName, status (ON/OFF)

Concrete method: turnOn() and turnOff() that change status

Abstract method: showDeviceInfo()

Create subclasses:

SmartLight

SmartThermostat

Each should:

Implement Connectable

Override showDeviceInfo() to print device details.

In the main() method:

Create a list of SmartDevice objects (both lights and thermostats)

Turn them on, connect to Wi-Fi, and display info using a loop.

🧠 Goal: Practice combining abstract classes + interfaces + polymorphism + real-world structure.
