Create a class BankAccount that:

Has private fields: accountNumber, balance, and password

Allows deposit and withdraw only through getter/setter methods

Uses validation (e.g., password check before withdrawal)

In the main class:

Create an account

Try to withdraw and deposit money

Print balance after every transaction

Goal: Practice access modifiers, getters/setters, and security logic with encapsulation.
