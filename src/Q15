Create a base class Payment with a method processPayment().

Then create subclasses:

CreditCardPayment

PayPalPayment

UPIPayment

Each class should override processPayment() differently.
In your main method, store all in a list of type Payment and iterate to call processPayment() polymorphically.

Bonus: Ask the user which payment type they want and call the correct subclass dynamically.
