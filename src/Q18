Create a base class Employee with fields:

name, id, salary
and a method calculateBonus() that returns 10% of salary.

Then make subclasses:

Manager → bonus = 20%

Developer → bonus = 15%

In main(), create an array of employees (mix of Manager and Developer) and print their bonus using runtime polymorphism.

Goal: Understand method overriding and polymorphic arrays.
