Create an abstract class Vehicle with:

Abstract methods: start(), stop()

Non-abstract method: fuelType() that prints the fuel type.

Then create 3 subclasses:
Car, Bike, and ElectricScooter that implement the abstract methods differently.
Write a main class that stores all vehicles in an array and calls their methods using a loop.

Goal: Practice abstract class, method overriding, and polymorphic calls.
